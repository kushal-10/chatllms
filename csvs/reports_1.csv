It emphasizes the need for a resilient and future-proof supply chain, especially in the face of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report mentions that supply chain disruptions have been widespread, affecting more than 90% of Fortune 1000 companies, including technology companies. These disruptions have exposed weaknesses in the supply chain, such as limited data, insufficient risk management, and a lack of agility. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to focus on transforming their supply chain function.

To achieve a resilient and future-proof supply chain, the report suggests several key points. First, it mentions the importance of implementing a robust data collection system integrated with AI and predictive analytics. This system can provide a cohesive picture of the entire supply chain, enhancing planning capabilities and the ability to respond efficiently to potential threats.

The report also highlights the benefits of digital technologies in supply chain management. These technologies include advanced tracking and tracing, predictive analytics, cognitive decision centers, and intelligent automation. When deployed correctly, these technologies can streamline processes and change the fundamentals of supply chain management.

In terms of organizational structure, the report mentions the KPMG Target Operating Model (TOM), which offers a pre-built operating model based on six layers of change. These layers include the overall functional process, people, technology, performance insights and data, governance, and service delivery model. The TOM helps organizations execute an operational reset and implement cloud technology to optimize service delivery and achieve desired outcomes with lower risk.

The report also emphasizes the importance of upskilling employees for the digital age. It suggests that hiring more digital talents is not always the best solution and that developing strategies to enhance workforce adaptability during the transformation process is key.

Additionally, the report discusses the benefits of geographical expansion into emerging markets and the complexity and extra costs associated with it. It suggests using micro supply chains to balance the cost of complexity with the value gained from offering variety. Micro supply chains enable manufacturers to switch sources, production, and delivery at short notice and adapt to changes in demand.

Lastly, the report mentions the rise of digital platforms and the opportunity for organizations to become as-a-service providers. This can generate new revenue streams and monetize surplus asset capacity, mitigating costs.

Overall, the report emphasizes the need for organizations to transform their supply chain function by leveraging digital technologies, implementing a robust data collection system, and focusing on workforce upskilling. By doing so, organizations can build a resilient and future-proof supply chain that can adapt to changing market dynamics and customer expectations."
