Synchromodality refers to the coordinated and flexible use of different transportation modes in order to optimize efficiency and sustainability in freight transportation. The paper highlights the importance of considering the entire supply chain when making decisions about transportation modes and infrastructure.

The paper begins by reviewing the development of multimodal transportation and the recent evolution of the synchromodality concept. It argues that synchromodality needs to be more deeply embedded in supply chain management and proposes the expression ""Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective"" (SSCP) to reflect this.

One of the main focuses of the paper is on the modal shift decision-making process. It provides a quantitative analysis on how shippers make modal shift decisions compared to logistics service providers (LSPs). The authors emphasize that shippers need to consider trade-offs and synergies across the supply chain as a whole when making these decisions. The quantitative analysis aims to complement previous qualitative research in this area.

The paper also discusses the potential environmental benefits of synchromodality. It presents a case study demonstrating how a shipper can increase the modal share of intermodal rail and road from 30% to 70% in one intermodal rail corridor. This modal shift results in a 6% total logistics cost saving and a 30% reduction in emissions. The paper proposes that synchromodality offers a potential solution to promote a substantial modal shift to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.

Overall, the paper aims to fill a research gap by providing a quantitative study and best practices case studies on synchromodality from a supply chain perspective. It explores the concept, discusses its potential benefits, and provides practical insights for companies looking to optimize their freight transportation strategies."
